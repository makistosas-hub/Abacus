  - id: "data"
    heading: "Where is our data stored?"
    body: |
      By default data resides in the EU (Frankfurt or Warsaw). We can deploy into your VPC or run a hybrid model where sensitive sources never leave your network.
    bullets:
      - "Files encrypted with AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit"
      - "Access logs streamable to your SIEM"
  - id: "training"
    heading: "Do you train models on our data?"
    body: |
      No. Your data is used for inference only. Models run on secured servers and cannot persist temporary data outside the execution environment.
  - id: "limits"
    heading: "What limits apply?"
    body: |
      Starter includes 500 documents and 10 workflow runs per month. Growth and Enterprise plans offer configurable limits with automatic scaling.

    heading: "How long do integrations take?"
    body: |
      Standard integrations with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace ship within 3–5 business days. Custom API work depends on your infrastructure complexity.
  - id: "support"
    heading: "What support is included?"
    body: |
      Starter offers business-hours email support. Growth adds shared Slack access and recurring success reviews, while Enterprise includes 24/7 coverage and a dedicated CSM.

      Cancel from the admin console at any time. We issue a final invoice and provide a 30-day data export window.
